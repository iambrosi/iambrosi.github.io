My name is Ismael Ambrosi and I live in Montevideo, Uruguay. Since 2006 I work as web developer, which is my passion and I feel lucky of being able to work in something I really like. The main tools I use are [Symfony][symfony] and [AngularJS][angularjs], for PHP and JavaScript respectively.

I work as _Frontend Developer_ at [VividCortex][vividcortex], a _startup_ based in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Always investigating and looking for new technologies and self-improvement. Someone once told me I am a "testing freak", joking of course, but not too far from reality :) Yes, I like to test my code, and I always encourage people to do so.

I also like to participate in meetups and community events. Co-organizer of the PHP Montevideo meetup and the Symfony user group in Uruguay. I also help and collaborate in whatever is needed with the organizers of the [TechMeetup][techmeetup], since the third edition of the conference. For me, this has been an awesome experience.
